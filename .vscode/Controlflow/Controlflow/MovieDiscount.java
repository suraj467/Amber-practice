/*Part 2: Movie Discounts
    A movie cinema does price discounting depending on a customer's age.
    The app prompts a user to enter their age on the IntelliJ console after which it checks whether the user meets the discount conditions.
    Age range	Ticket Price
    Normal ticket	7 Euros
    Below 5	60% Discount
    Over 60	55% Discount
    Write the app so that the conditions above are met and the correct ticket price is returned.
    Extra features
    If done with the first part of the exercise with time to spare add the following feature.
    
    Have the app prompt normal ticket buyers for the number of tickets they wish to buy.
    For every two or more tickets sold, give a 30% discount. */
