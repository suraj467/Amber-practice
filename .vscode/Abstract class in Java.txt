Abstract class in Java 
// notes 14/0/2024 .........
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first.

Abstraction in Java
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

Ways to achieve Abstraction
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

Abstract class (0 to 100%)
Interface (100%)

Abstract class in Java
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember
An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

keyword
In Java, final, finally, and finalize are three distinct keywords with different purposes: 
final:
Access Modifier: Used to declare a variable, method, or class as unchangeable.
Variable: A final variable becomes a constant, and its value cannot be modified once assigned.
Method: A final method cannot be overridden in subclasses.
Class: A final class cannot be inherited from. 
finally:
Exception Handling: Used in a try-catch-finally block to define a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. This is often used for cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources. 
finalize():
Garbage Collection: A method called by the garbage collector just before an object is reclaimed. This method is used to perform cleanup operations, but its use is discouraged.
